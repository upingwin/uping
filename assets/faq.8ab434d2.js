For example, if Bob minted a number 555, exactly the number Alice minted before, and between them someone has minted 98 different numbers, then Bob and Alice will win this prize pool (100MATIC), each earning 48.5MATIC(100*97%/2).</h5><h2>Are the numbers completely random?</h2><h5>Random numbers are generated by Chainlink Verifiable Random Function (VRF) \uFF0Cthe industry standard random number generator (RNG) solution for smart contracts that require a cryptographically secure, transparent, and provably fair source of randomness. <a class="text-primary" href="https://chain.link/chainlink-vrf" target="_blank">learn more</a></h5><h2>Why does my number show as \u201C???\u201D\uFF1F</h2><h5>It takes about 1-2 minutes to generate random numbers, please wait and refresh the page. If there is congestion on the chain, the waiting time will be longer.</h5><h2>Can I mint multiple times in a row?</h2><h5>Of course, the more numbers you have, the more chances you have to win. If you are lucky, you can win a lot, but you can also lose a lot, so please pay attention to risk management.</h5><h2>Is there an additional fee for withdrawals?</h2><h5>3% of each prize pool is reserved for the developer, and the winner shares the other 97% equally. The prize can be withdrawn to your wallet at any time for a small gas fee.</h5><h2>Any other tips or suggestions?</h2><h5>0x999 is new, unaudited, and not guaranteed to work perfectly. Before participate, do your own research: ask questions, check out the code, understand the risks and good luck!</h5><h5>Twitter DM is now open, please feel free to give feedback if you have any questions or suggestions.</h5>',18),f=u(" Back to the home page "),y={setup(b){const n=r();return(w,e)=>(s(),i("div",d,[t("div",m,[p,t("div",{class:"btn btn-primary mt-10 btn-outline",onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=g=>a(n).back())},[h(a(l),{class:"w-4 mr-4"}),f])])]))}};typeof o=="function"&&o(y);export{y as default};
